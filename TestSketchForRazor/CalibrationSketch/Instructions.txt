TODO: Write instructions for calibration.

Calibration Process for Magnetometer: Attempt to paint the interior surface of a sphere of infinite radius centered at your point of existence while pretending the IMU is an infinitely long marker of infinitesimal size. Just pretend, it's more fun that way.

Calibration process for Accelerometer: Point the accelerometer towards the 6 cardinal axes, take readings for the one in line with gravity. Apply a shift to any axes that aren't centered about 0. Divide by the sensitivity of the Accelerometer and ensure the values are 1 at the ends. If the values are greater than the sensitivity we might have issues, still need to determine and re-write if needed.

Calibration process for Gyro: Just put it on the table. Don't touch it even though you probably want to.

Data processing to determine calibration numbers: excel things after my account is setup.
